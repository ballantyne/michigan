# michigan

I have cleaned the basic functionality.  I still haven't really attempted to obtain the filings.  Shouldn't be too difficult to do.  I guess I could write more of a readme, but I recently changed the names of functions, so why not wait a little while longer.

If michigan wants their name back I am happy to hand it over.  Also if they want to maintain this code I would be ok with that too.  

```javascript

var cofs = require('michigan/cofs.lara.state.mi.us');
cofs.entities('ford').then((searchList) => { console.log(searchList) })
```
